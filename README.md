# llsm
`llsm` is a set of Scala libraries for preprocessing and conversion of raw data
from early implementations of the Lattice Light-sheet Microscope<sup>1</sup>.

Features include:

* Read and parse LLSM metadata from raw LLSM data.
* Read LLSM data.
* Deskew LLSM volumes.
* Output LLSM volumes as OME-TIFF.

`llsm` is underpinned by Typelevel and ImageJ/Fiji community libraries including `cats`, `imglib2` and `scifio`.

__Note: Please be aware that these libraries are still in heavy development and are likely to change substantially.__

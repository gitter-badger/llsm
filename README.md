# llsm
`llsm` is a set of Scala libraries for preprocessing and conversion of raw data
from early implementations of the Lattice Light-sheet Microscope<sup>1</sup>.

__Note: Please be aware that these libraries are still in heavy development and are likely to change substantially. Moreover, some parts are likely to not work yet!__

# Introduction
`llsm` is a set of Scala libraries and application code for working with Lattice Light Sheet Microscopy (LLSM) data. It aims to set out a standard way for preprocessing LLSM data and encoding it in open image formats. Features include:
* Read and parse LLSM metadata from raw LLSM data.
* Read LLSM data.
* De-skew LLSM volumes.
* Output LLSM volumes as OME-TIFF.

`llsm` is underpinned by the ImageJ community libraries.

# Note
`llsm` is largely not functional yet. We are only just starting out.
